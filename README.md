I analyzed a **pizza sales dataset** using **SQL**, where I cleaned the data by fixing missing values, removing duplicates, and organizing it for better analysis. After preparing the data, I **saved the cleaned version** for further use.  

Using this data, I created an **interactive Tableau dashboard** with two interconnected views. Users can switch between them using **buttons**. The **first dashboard (Home Dashboard)** displays overall **sales performance and analysis**, showing key trends and insights. The **second dashboard** focuses on the **Top 5 performers** across different categories like **sales, orders, and revenue**, making it easy to compare and track high-performing pizzas and trends.
