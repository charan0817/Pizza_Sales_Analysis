# Pizza_Sales_Analysis
I conducted an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a **pizza sales dataset** using **SQL**, which involved multiple stages of data preparation and cleaning. The dataset initially contained inconsistencies, missing values, and redundant information that needed to be addressed before further analysis. I performed various **data cleaning techniques**, including handling null values, standardizing formats, and removing duplicate records to ensure the dataset was accurate and reliable for deeper insights. Additionally, I carried out **aggregations and transformations** to structure the data effectively for analysis.  

Once the data was cleaned and properly formatted, I **saved the refined dataset** for further use. This step was essential in maintaining data integrity and allowing seamless integration with visualization tools. The cleaned dataset provided a well-organized foundation for deriving meaningful insights and visualizing key metrics related to pizza sales, such as revenue trends, popular pizza categories, and customer preferences.  

Using the **saved dataset**, I designed and developed an **interactive dashboard in Tableau** to bring the analysis to life. The dashboard incorporated various **charts, filters, and KPIs**, enabling users to explore trends dynamically. It provided a comprehensive view of sales performance, highlighting **top-selling pizzas, sales fluctuations over time, and customer purchase behavior**. By leveraging Tableauâ€™s interactive capabilities, the dashboard allowed users to **drill down into specific details**, enhancing data-driven decision-making for business strategies.
